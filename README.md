## 📋 Overview

**DairiX** is a cutting-edge web application that simulates a robotics-driven dairy service platform. Engineered with a minimalist "Tesla-style" aesthetic, the system provides a seamless interface for businesses to deploy fleets of autonomous rovers. It features a complete end-to-end simulation from user authentication to technical specification review and professional contract signing.
